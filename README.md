## [02BreakECDSAcryptography](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/tree/main/02BreakECDSAcryptography)

* Analyze the data from the file "RawTX.json". Script breakECDSA.py reconstructs the unsigned message for each to find the Z value. The result is returned as R, S, Z, PUBKEY for each of the inputs present in the data in the "RawTX.json" file.

## [06KangarooJeanLucPons](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/tree/main/06KangarooJeanLucPons)

* Pollard's kangaroo method computes discrete logarithms in arbitrary cyclic groups. It is applied when the discrete logarithm is known to lie within a certain range, say [ a , b ], and then has the expected time to execute the bulk operation. One way to break ECDSA signature schemes is to solve the discrete logarithm problem.

## [08ReducePrivateKey](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/tree/main/08ReducePrivateKey)

* In this repository, we will use scripts that will help reduce the private key knowing only the leak from the "BLOCKCHAIN FOLBIT LEAKS" list and the public key from "UTXO".

## [09BitcoinWalletRecovery](https://github.com/demining/CryptoDeepTools/tree/main/09BitcoinWalletRecovery)

* We all know that the disclosure of the private key in the ECDSA signature can lead to the complete recovery of the Bitcoin Wallet. In our earlier articles, we looked at weaknesses and vulnerabilities in blockchain transactions, but there are also ECDSA short signatures that also lead to the full recovery of a Bitcoin Wallet.
